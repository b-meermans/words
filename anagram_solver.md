## Problem Statement

An anagram is formed by rearranging the letters of one word or phrase and building another word or phrase. Design a valid anagram finder which, given a sequence of letters, finds all *valid anagrams* of the the sequence of letters. An anagram is *valid* if it is found within the provided [words.txt](https://github.com/b-meermans/words/blob/main/words.txt) list.

1. The program should prompt the user for a sequence of letters.
2. Inputs with non-alphabetic characters do not need to be addressed.
3. The program should use the words.txt file to verify validity of candidate anagrams.
4. The program should display all valid anagrams of the given sequence of letters.

## Example
```
Anagrams for: care
acer
acre
race
```
